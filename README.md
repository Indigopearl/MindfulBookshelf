# MindfulBookshelf: Your Online Haven for Mindful Reads

From a bookshelf overflowing with stories to a digital haven for like-minded readers, MindfulBookshelf is an online bookstore born from a passion for sharing the transformative power of books. This project serves as a practical application of my journey learning Django, MySQL, and REST Framework.

**Features:**

* **Dive into diverse categories:** Explore a curated selection of specialized literature, motivational reads, and self-discovery resources, with clear categories and subcategories for easy navigation.
* **Uncover hidden gems:** Find your next favorite read through our intuitive search functionality, allowing you to filter by genre, subject, and author.
* **Delve deeper:** Each book page offers comprehensive descriptions, reviews from fellow readers, and even reading samples to pique your curiosity.

**Tasks:**

**Backend (Django, REST Framework):**

* Develop models to represent books, categories, reviews, and user accounts.
* Implement API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and reviews.
* Handle user authentication and authorization.

**Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

* Design a user-friendly interface for browsing books, searching the catalog, and viewing detailed information.
* Utilize APIs to fetch book data and display it dynamically.
* Implement user account features and review functionalities.

**Database (MySQL):**

* Configure and manage the database to store book information, reviews, and user data.

**Deployment:**

* Set up version control with Git for code management and collaboration.
* Host the application on a desired platform.

**This project is an ongoing learning experience. Feel free to explore the code, contribute your ideas, and help us build a thriving community of mindful readers!**

**Note:** This readme includes optional functionalities for user accounts and a shopping cart system. You can adapt the tasks section based on your current development stage and desired features.
